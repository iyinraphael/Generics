# Generics
Generic code enables you to write flexible, resuable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define. YOu can write code that avoids duplication and expresses its intenet in a clear, abstracted manner.

Generics are one of the most powerful features of Swift, and much of the Swift standard library is built with generic code. Generics can also be defined as a placeholder type.
